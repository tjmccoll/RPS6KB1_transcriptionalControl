# Bioinformatic inference of the exercise-responsive control of p70 S6 kinase through *RPS6KB1* expression
## Overview
This study applies the [Causal Reasoning pipeline for Network identification using Integer VALue programming (CARNIVAL) tool](https://saezlab.github.io/CARNIVAL/), developed by the Saez Lab, to infer the transcriptional control of *RPS6KB1* following acute aerobic or resistance exercise. We used two complimentary approaches: 
1. The **standard CARNIVAL approach** was applied to infer the signaling networks that control transcription factors targeting *RPS6KB1* downstream of canonical exercise-sensitive proteins (e.g., AMPK isoforms, CaMKs, MAP3Ks).
2. The **inverse CARNIVAL approach** was applied to identify potential upstream signaling networks that may control the transcription factors targeting *RPS6KB1*.

This tool is being developed by the [Clarke Laboratory for Quantitative Exercise Biology](https://www.sfu.ca/clarkelab-bpk.html). Further information can be found in the following study.
